And to make matter worse, the restaurant did nothing to make it right.

First, a little about me: I used to work in the food service industry. This means it takes a lot for me to get upset at a restaurant. Like, a lot. I've been in the shoes of these workers, I know how crazy it gets when there's a lot of orders. It pretty much takes someone spitting in my food in front of me for a reaction.

But what happened to me last night was unacceptable.

We got there around 6:45 to find a super-packed restaurant with a long wait to dine there. So, we opted to order take-out instead. Placed our order, was told to come back in about 30 minutes to pick up our food. No problem, totally reasonable.

We went to the store to buy some booze to go with our meal. Then, we came back to the restaurant around 7:30 to pick up our food. They told me it would be a few more minutes. No problem.

So then, I waited. And then waited some more. Then, I waited a little more. I checked on my order, was told they needed longer. At this point, I'm seeing people arrive, put their names in, and get seated and served appetizers. Something isn't right.

Being the slightly traumatized food industry veteran I am, I remained calm and waited longer because I have empathy for the workers. Saw more people get sat. Saw more people served foods and more to-go orders fly out. Asked again about my order, was told again it needed more time.

Keep in mind, this was an order for two people: Ciopinno, BBQ Salmon, and creme brule. That's it. A feast for two but hardly a massive order.

Finally, at about 8:20, the girl working at the front told me ""there was a problem with my order and they needed time to fix it."" No way, I can't believe it! It came out around 8:30. It took an hour and a half to get my food. Nearly two hours if you count when we arrived there and ordered around 6:45

I tried to be nice, but feel pretty upset about my experience here. It wasn't a cheap dinner and they didn't even try to make it right. No free dessert. No comp. Nothing. Just had me standing in that parking lot like an idiot for over an hour.

Screw you, too.",3/31/2021,1

I was patiently waiting in line along with three other customers when we had been cut off by someone from the side entrance of the restaurant. Everyone had honked their horns and waived at the guy making it obvious that there was another line. The guy ignorantly waived back and flipped us off and continued to pursue staying in the line. Once I had finally reached the intercom to order I had notified the general manager Brianna that she should not serve the car in front of us because he had shortcut all the cars behind him and was ignorantly waving back and flipping us off. Briana had then stated okay as if she was assuring that she was going to State something to the car ahead of us. When it came to that customer pulling up to pay we had noticed. The manager hadn't even told him anything. He had simply been told his total and he paid for whatever he had ordered. Once I had pulled up I had stated,"" Are you kidding me right now did you guys really just serve him after I had just stated to you guys that he had shortcut everyone and had ignorantly flipped us off and continued to pursue the line?  the cashier had then stated that she was not on the microphone so she wasn't the one that I had talked to. So she had turned around and grabbed the person who was on the intercom so they could speak to me. The person who is on the intercom was Brianna the general manager. She had stated to me I had to basically just get over it and be the bigger man and that she could not refuse the service because she needed to get the sell off since he had already placed an order. I was so shocked because she was the general manager and she had stated this to me. I have never in my life ran into a general manager who has told me that I had to get over it instead of fixing or resolving the issue. In my eyes I believe Brianna should not even be in the position she is in. This restaurant chain is one of the greatest but when you have someone like this running the store it makes it look really bad and unorganized.

First of all the server was very rushed and seemed pretty annoyed with us for asking questions. My boyfriend ordered a burger and a full rack of ribs and I ordered the mushroom pasta. About 3 minutes after we put our order in the server came back and told us they were out of burgers and ribs for the night and asked us to pick something else. So my boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster tail instead, he asked for the steak to be medium rare. About 10 minutes later I received my pasta and the server brought my boyfriend a full rack of ribs, we were really confused because they had told us there were no ribs and asked us to order something else, at this point we decided to just let it go and eat the ribs and the steak and lobster. The ribs were super dry but alright, the pasta was cold and honestly not very appealing. Then came the lobster and steak, we took one look at the steak and could tell it was not cooked properly, I took a little bite of it and it was basically beef jerky, it was so dry. Then we tried the lobster, it was completely inedible, we both had to spit it out. We ended up eating probably 40% of the meal we paid for because it simply just wasn‚Äôt good.

It takes a lot for me to leave a bad review. I'm very understanding but from the second we got there the person in the front told us they can't find our reservation. That we never booked one. Then started asking if I talked to a woman or man I pulled my call history up showing I called for the reservation in the morning. I also showed the call when were going to be late and everything was fine over the phone. I specifically asked over the phone if they had crab legs as well and was told yes. Then was told that they might not be able to get us in. Took 30 minutes to get a seat outside with reservation. Anyhow we were able to look past this as long the food was good.  Turns out that the waiter was horrible. I hate to say this but he took over 15 minutes to come and ask for drinks.  Then another 10 minutes to actually bring waters. Then everything we tried to order was gone. No oysters so because they had no oysters they wouldn't serve crab legs although they have them. To me this was crazy. Then I asked for chicken tenders and fries for my almost 3 year old and they say they didn't have them yet the persons kid next to us was served chicken tenders and fries. We ended up ordering the kids pasta and he said he would have them put Mariana sauce and it came with only butter. Then said they don't have marinara. On top of all of this the bartender just shows up with a beer. (my husband is drinking a bloody Mary) and he tells him we didn't order that. Then he comes back with another bloodymary but we didn't order another one. Then when they bring the food a big extra side of fries comes and we didn't order that either. I asked the waiter to check the paper where he wrote our order down and he said he did and that on the order we never ordered a bloody Mary but we did order the fries. I was so confused by the entire situation.  It made zero sense and was super frustrating.  We almost didn't even eat. However the prime rib eye and the lobster carbonara was pretty good nothing special that we would go back for. There are so many better places in laguna !! this was recommended by a few people but unfortunately I have nothing but unsatisfactory things to say except that the toffee cake and vanilla ice cream are to die for !!!

The hostess was helpful and the wait time was very short. However, the bartender was very rude. She approached us and asked us our order with a very uncaring look and displeased tone. I didn't think much of it until another couple sat next to us. The bartender was very attentive to this couple, she suggested meals/drinks, was very happy to help them and checked in on them a few times. She did not approach us throughout the visit other than to hand us the check. The bartender was also attentive (and friendly) to the other four couples at the bar so I'm unsure why we received such poor service other than we didn't LOOK like the other couples. Also, the food was underwhelming and somewhat bland.

Where to start?
Ordered drinks with dinner. We saw them get made. Then we saw them wait there at the bar.  Many others got their drinks while we waited. Oh,  when I made the reservations I was asked if it was a special occasion and yes it was - it was our 25th anniversary. Did anyone at any time say anything about this - absolutely not.  Here‚Äôs a hint. When you try to make it look like you are in special place and you ask someone coming to your establishment to spend money and you ask if it is a special occasion then you may want to make it look like you care about customers and say something about the supposed special night. Not this place.
Then when someone orders a bottle of wine that sells for over $100 and you don‚Äôt have the bottle available you might want to mention it prior to food being served. We ordered drinks and ate our appetizers because it was past 8 PM and we were hungry. No drinks. We had food delivered and then told the wine we ordered was not available. Dinner was half eaten by the time the manager wasted his time coming to apologize.
I say wasted his time because:
We ordered coffee and desert. Coffee comes with no sweetener or spoon. The waitress brings the sweetener but no spoon.
Fail.    Fail.    Fail.     Never would I ever want to step foot into this establishment ever ever again.
That waitress was either very incompetent or she didn‚Äôt want to serve me and my husband. Who knows?

Explanation:
I had made a reservation a week in advance and shared with the hostess that we were going there for my girlfriend's birthday celebration. Once we arrived, the hostess that was there acknowledge that it was my girlfriend's birthday. I asked her if we could wait a little bit longer to be sat since we are waiting for 2 more people to join us.
Once our friends arrived they told us that a table was ready in the patio -which is what I had requested- but there was a huge detail that they left out. They brought us to a table without an umbrella... It was 88 degrees outside and there were no clouds on site! Since I immediately noticed that we were the only ones missing an umbrella (on the left side on the patio), I asked the person that walked us to our table if he could get us an umbrella. He said: ""I will ask your server to bring you one."" Walked away, and we sat on the table. Our server comes, and she puts plates in the middle and says her introduction. Which is fine. But when I ask if there is an umbrella that they could bring us, she said that they didn't have any. (no apologies, just a no.) She then said, with a rude attitude, that we could look at the menu from the paper that was on the table, and left.
We were all dehydrating in the blazing sun within seconds, so we decided to move to another table. As we were walking through a ramp to go back inside to talk to the host/hostess, there was a lady with short brown hair, that appeared to be the manager,  that demanded my group in a very rude way to clear the path.
My group and I were trying to stay polite and friendly since it was my girlfriend's birthday. My friend asked a worker if we could move to a table that he had spotted at the opposite corner from where we were placed. The worker joked that we couldn't then he laughed and said that he would clean it and he would have it ready for us soon.
From that moment on, everything was pretty normal. We sat inside for 1 minute; we were directed to our table; our server greeted us, and even though he was brand new there, it was a pleasure to see that he was at least trying. But overall, HORRIBLE PLACE TO GO.

Last comment, I noticed that they were placing any black person in the blazing sun. I am not black, but I have some empathy, and there were two black ladies that were placed in a table near us where the sun was directly hitting them. They did not seemed pleased at all the entire time. and ended up leaving.

Get appetizers but no napkins or silverware. No one came around so had to get up and grab them ourselves. Want to have empty plates removed from your table?
